Site needs:
- 1+ toppings -- method of selecting toppings (just one to start: plain and pepperoni)
- 1+ size -- needs 2 size options
x pizza object constructor w/ properties for toppings and size
- prototype method for cost based on toppings and size
- method of determining price

Need to add selection boxes for topping and size, put those functions into the prototypes
Then write function or prototype to collect info and return a price. Will need to be if...else format

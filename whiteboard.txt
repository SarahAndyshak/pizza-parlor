Site needs:
x 1+ toppings -- method of selecting toppings (just one to start: plain and pepperoni)
x 1+ size -- needs 2 size options
x pizza object constructor w/ properties for toppings and size
x prototype method for cost based on toppings and size
x method of determining price

Layout:
- method of selecting size
- method of selecting topping
x submit button
- show/hide final price

Need to add selection boxes for topping and size, put those functions into the prototypes
Then write function or prototype to collect info and return a price. Will need to be if...else format

Options:
no toppings, personal pizza -- base price: $5
no toppings, family pizza -- base price $10
pepperoni, personal -- $2 topping, $5 size -- $7
pepperoni, family -- $2 topping, $10 size -- $12

3pm 1/27 update: constructor works. HTML shows up. pizzaSelection() works if pizzaOrder object is declared with variables -- not talking to buttons at this point. assignCost prototype works if pizzaOrder object is declared with variables (same issue). When pizzaSelection() is run, it creates a pizzaOrder object, but that object isn't recognized by the console in testing.
